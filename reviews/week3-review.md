# Week 3 Submission Review Notes

Reviewed `week3 (2).zip` contents for the Mod 3 Lab submission.

## Observations
- `index.html` links to `styles/main.css`, includes the town hall header with the 75th superscript, and lists the three guest speakers with linked names and speaker images.
- `styles/main.css` defines a reset selector, custom properties for color, a centered 600px body with a border and background, header gradient and borders, italicized blockquote, and footer styling.
- Speaker pages in `speakers/` include a return link back to `index.html`.
